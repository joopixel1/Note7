# Note7
This is a note app for writing ur thoughts and ideas and todo on an easily available and safe location.

I used Kotlin in android studio. The major api I used was fragments using jetpacks library navigation component and would be a good example for anyone looking for how to use fragments.
I also used AlarmManager, AlarmService apis, which was a good way for me to be introduced to sending intents, flags and broadcasts.
